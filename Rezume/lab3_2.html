    <p>Justin Beaver confessed something that even his greatest fans would have never expected of the skilled musicians and lyricist.
    the young rock-and-roller admitted that since he typed his first title tag, his life became easier. It has been reported by those surrounding the Canadian that Beaver`s private mentors, Ryan Loseling and Nicolas Crate, often walk around Los Angeles disputing what a great tool the HTML validator is.</p>
